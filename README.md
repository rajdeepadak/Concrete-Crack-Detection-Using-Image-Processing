# Concrete-Crack-Detection-Using-Image-Processing
Simple Image processing based algorithm detects cracks on concrete roads. The algorithm was run on a raspberry pi 3b+ board mounted on a autonomous drone. A downward pointing camera records and simultaneously detects cracks when the drone navigates above a concrete road surface.
